# To-Do:

* [x] List
* [ ] Change the allocator to use memory blocks with header instead of struct
* [ ] Change allocator to return a counted reference memory blocks
* [ ] create and allocator to hold deferred deallocations
* [ ] Create an iterator (begin, end, next, previous, range) interface and aware of ref count
* [ ] Fix containers reserve and shrink functions
* [ ] HashMap
* [ ] Strings
* [ ] Tree
* [ ] Tests

# Back Burner:
* [ ] Trie
* [ ] Move constructors for every container
* [ ] Fix Potential Allocator fragmentation due to composite freelists
