MTL - Minimal Template Library

This work is derived from my Minimal Game Engine project. I have decided to split what I had develop for that project into 2 parts. The containers implementations were moved into this repo and will be developed as an independent project. For information regarding the entity component system please check the hydrogine repo.

This project is released under the MIT license.
